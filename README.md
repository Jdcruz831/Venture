# Venture

Venture is a social media app I have started creating. It is a location based social media that only allows users to post or see other users posts when they are within a small distance. Venturs main focus is getting people up and moving about their communities to see what other people posted and to be able to post themselves.

## Getting Started

This is an all google based project using flutter/Dart and using googles map api for the main homepage. I will eventully use googles app hosting servers as well as I continue. 

## So far 

As of now the main google map api is visable and I am working on the user homepage and access menu.
